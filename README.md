## New hardpoint system
Buy hardpoints by spending your hard earned credits and take control of the game. There is no longer need to camp to get hard to reach hardpoints, get your credits by killing your enemies and gain even more by getting headshots and melee kills. You won't lose any of the credits on death so feel free to rush enemy team or bring your hidden ninja to the game.
